# Art Museums
D3.js globe visualizing geotagged instagram photos of art museums around the world (Project for Data Visualizations). This uses Socket.IO to plot Instagram data in realtime.

## Inspiration
I am a museum junkie. It is the cheapest thing to do in any city and a way to kill time. In the summer when internships do not pan out the way I want to, or on breaks from school where I need to occupy my time, museums are an escape from staring at my computer screen. All I need is train fare and whatever cash that is in my pocket. If the museum is funded by the Bloomberg Foundation, admission is a suggested donation.

Art museums and other accessible, low cost public services have power. Services like Public Broadcasting or Public Radio or nationally funded arts programs, museums, and archives are important in a democratic society, because they dictate national discourse. What makes its way into public knowledge is decided by what the public has access to and what remains in the shadows. Representation in public discourse matters. 

I came across an article showing the [most Instagrammed Museums of 2016](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/most-instagrammed-museums-2016-768923). What better way to show how museums are still relevent to our society than through a popular social media site!

## Use Cases

2. Zoom in and select data points plotted around the globe to view the Instagram photo and caption.
